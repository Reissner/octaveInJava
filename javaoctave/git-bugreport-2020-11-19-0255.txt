Thank you for filling out a Git bug report!
Please answer the following questions to help us understand your issue.

What did you do before the bug happened? (Steps to reproduce your issue)
i have a workspace with untracked files, else clean. 
then i did `git describe`. 
What did you expect to happen? (Expected behavior)
I exptected to see a label 'dirty' 
What happened instead? (Actual behavior)
no label `dirty`
What's different between what you expected and what actually happened?
obvious
Anything else you want to add:
I know that this is not precisely a bug, 
Instead it is a feature request. 
Practically, `git describe` is used to determine a version. 
For me the sense of 'dirty' is to indicate that this deliverable is not reproducible from the repo. 
Thus it may not be delivered to a customer. 
So in this sense, untracked files make a workspace dirty also. 

Without the need of backward compatibility, i would say, dirty is all, 
which is tracked and modified staged or not, 
or which is untracked but not ignored. 

To keep backward compatibility, 
maybe it is a good idea to add a second suffix, maybe 'untracked'. 
That way it is clear: only if no suffix is present, it can be delivered. 

Please review the rest of the bug report below.
