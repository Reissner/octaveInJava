A bridge to integrate octave (gnu octave, a matlab clone) into java code. 

This github project stems from https://github.com/AngeAnalytics/java-octave 
and shall be synchronized with it. 


Prerequisites: 
- java 8 is needed, we tested with java 11
- essentially all octave versions work (we don't know about prior 3.0.0) 
  but we tested with 5.2.0 
- currently, octave shall have package `quaternion` version 2.4.0 installed.
